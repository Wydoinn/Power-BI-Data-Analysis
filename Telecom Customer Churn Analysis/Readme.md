### üéØ Key Objectives
- Predict customer churn likelihood using behavioral patterns
- Identify high-risk customer segments
- Analyze financial impact of customer churn
- Develop data-driven retention strategies

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Data Preparation (Power Query)
```powerquery
// Convert TotalCharges to numeric
= Table.TransformColumnTypes(Source, {{"TotalCharges", type number}})

// Create tenure buckets
= Table.AddColumn(#"Previous Step", "TenureBucket", 
    each if [tenure] <= 12 then "0-12" 
    else if [tenure] <= 24 then "13-24" 
    else if [tenure] <= 48 then "25-48" 
    else "49+")

// Clean service columns
= Table.ReplaceValue(#"Previous Step", "No internet service", "No", 
    Replacer.ReplaceText, {"OnlineSecurity", "OnlineBackup", "DeviceProtection"})
```

### Key DAX Measures

```dax
// Churn Rate Calculation
Churn Rate % = DIVIDE([Churned Customers], [Total Customers], 0)

// Revenue Lost from Churn
Revenue Lost = CALCULATE(SUM(Customers[TotalCharges]), Customers[Churn] = "Yes")

// Service Risk Score
ServiceScore = 
IF(Customers[OnlineSecurity]="No",1,0) + 
IF(Customers[OnlineBackup]="No",1,0) + 
IF(Customers[DeviceProtection]="No",1,0) + 
IF(Customers[TechSupport]="No",1,0)

// Projected Revenue (What-If Analysis)
Projected Revenue = [Revenue Retained] + ([Revenue Lost] * ('Retention Improvement %'[Value]/100))
```
